        <p>The Common Yabby, also known as the Blue Yabby or Cyan Yabby, is a freshwater crustacean belonging to the family Parastacidae. It has a hard exoskeleton that appears blue-green in color. It is native to Australia and found in various habitats, including rivers, streams, and swamps. They can also be found in ephemeral waterways, which are temporary streams that form during periods of heavy rainfall. Even when these waterways dry up, the Common Yabby can survive for years by burrowing deep into the mud.</p>
